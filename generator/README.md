# SNMP Exporter Config Generator

This config generator uses NetSNMP to parse MIBs, and generates configs for the snmp_exporter using them.

## Building

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsnmp-dev snmp-mibs-downloader  # Debian-based distros
go get github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/generator
cd ${GOPATH-$HOME/go}/src/github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/generator
go build
```

## Running

```
./generator generate
```

The generator reads in from `generator.yml` and writes to `snmp.yml`.

Additional command are available for debugging, use the `help` command to see them.

## HowTo

There is a simple [tutorial](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/tree/master/generator/Tutorial.md) for using generator to generate `snmp.yml` from `generator.yml`.

## Where to get MIBs

Some of these are quite sluggish, so use wget to download.

Put the extracted mibs in a location NetSNMP can read them from. `$HOME/.snmp/mibs` is one option.

## Exporter file format

This is generated by the generator, so only those doing development should have to care about how this works.
