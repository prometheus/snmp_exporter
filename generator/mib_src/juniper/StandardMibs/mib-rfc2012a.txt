            The only value which may be set by a management station is
            deleteTCB(12).  Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent
            to return a `badValue' response if a management station
            attempts to set this object to any other value.

            If a management station sets this object to the value
            deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB
            (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on
            the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the
            connection.

            As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be
            sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note
