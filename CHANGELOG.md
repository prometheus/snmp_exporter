This version of the exporter introduces a new configuration file format. This
new format separates the walk and metric mappings from the connection and
authentication settings. This allows for easier configuration of different
auth params without having to duplicate the full walk and metric mapping.

yum install net-snmp-python     # On Red Hat-based distros.
```
